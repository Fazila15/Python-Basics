Step 1: Create a Folder for Your Project.
Create a new folder for your Python project. You can name it something simple, like PythonBasics.


Step 2: Open the Folder in VS Code or Cursor.
Open PythonBasics folder in vs code or any other editor you have.


Step 3: Create a Python File
Inside the folder, create a new file. Name it something like hello_world.py.
Make sure the file ends with .py. This is the extension that tells Python that itâ€™s a Python script.


Step 4: Write Your First Python Code
Now, letâ€™s write a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python.
Open the hello_world.py file you just created in your text editor.
Type the following code inside the file:
print("Hello, World!")
Printing Information ðŸ“¢
To make the computer say something, we use the print() function.
This code tells Python to print the message Hello, World! on the terminal screen.


Step 5: Run the Python Code
On VS Code:
Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + J).
In the terminal, type the following command to run your Python script:
python hello_world.py
Now click enter and you should see Hello, World! on your terminal screen.

Thank you! ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations to you too for entering the world of Python! ðŸŽ‰

Now that you're in, the possibilities are endless. Let's keep going! ðŸ’»ðŸš€
