# Taking Input from the User ðŸ¤”
### We can ask the user to type something and store it in a variable.

#### Example:
name = input("What is your name? ")  # Ask for the name
print("Hello, " + name + "!")  # Greet the user
The computer will ask: "What is your name?" and then greet them with their name! ðŸ‘‹
