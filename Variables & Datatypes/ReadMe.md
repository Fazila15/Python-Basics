## ==> Variables: Storing Information 📦
A variable is like a box where you can store things. It helps us remember information.

### For example:
name = "Alice"  # This is a variable named 'name'
age = 10        # This is a variable named 'age'
Here, we stored the name "Alice" in the name box and the number 10 in the age box. 🗃️


## ==> Data Types: Different Kinds of Boxes 📦🔢
In Python, there are different types of boxes to store different things:

#### 1.Strings: Store text (e.g., names, words). Example: "Alice"
#### 2.Integers: Store whole numbers (e.g., 10, 25). Example: 10
#### 3.Floats: Store numbers with decimals (e.g., 5.7). Example: 5.7
#### 4.Booleans: Store true or false values. Example: True or False
